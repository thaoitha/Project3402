#Mushroom Classification

This project explores mushroom classification based off of edibility versus poisonous using machine learning techniques on the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).
The primary task involves classifying mushrooms into edible or poisonous categories based on their features, as defined by the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

My approach frames the problem as a binary classification task, utilizing various machine learning algorithms to predict the mushroom's class.

I used XGBoost and KNN models to assess their performance. Ultimately, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 99%, indicating strong predictive capability on this dataset.
